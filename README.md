- ### Quiz Start

    * Starting the quiz, the user will face a simple and intuitive quiz box and 15 questions to answer with 4 answers option each. The quiz box has a timer on top-right of the box, a live time-line. All the four options have a hover effect in order to grab the user attention as well as a question counter on the bottom-left of the screen.

    * If in any instance the timer goes off, the right answer option will be revealed with a light green background and a "tick" icon at the end, however, the user will not get any point for that.

    * Wheter the user selects a wrong answer, the selected option will get a light red background color with a cross icon at the end, as well as the right answer will be revealed.
